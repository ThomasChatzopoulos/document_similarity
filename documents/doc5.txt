Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were 
both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California.While conventional search engines 
ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized 
about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites. They called this new technology 
PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages 
that linked back to the original site.
